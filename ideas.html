    <h3>Project title: Webapp for learning algorithms</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Detailed Description: </b> We have a lot of algorithms in 20+
      programming languages in our GitHub repositories, but they are not
      properly organised and discoverability is not good. For a beginner, it
      becomes difficult to learn the algorithms and their implementation. For a
      person who is not familiar with Git or Github this can become a hurdle in
      learning. So we want to build an interactive web app where students can
      explore various algorithms and learn their implementation in the
      programming language of their choice. The code for these algorithms and
      their plain text explanation should be fetched automatically from Github
      repos and rendered in a readable form. Further this plain text explanation
      can also be multilingual.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Expected outcomes: </b>
      <ul>
        <li>An interactive multilingual web app to explore and learn algorithms in the programming language of their choice.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Skills Required: </b> HTML, CSS, JS, React, Next.js

    <h3>Project title: The Algorithms CMS</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Detailed Description: </b> Currently, the user has to clone a repository and 
      then commit new files on it to add a new algorithm. For someone who is not familiar 
      with git but is well-versed in algorithms, it would be difficult to contribute. The 
      CMS will present a web application to the users where they can write code for the 
      new algorithm and add plain text explanation. The CMS should parse the data and 
      automatically commit them to respective repositories. This will allow the visitors 
      to add the different programming language implementations and plain text translations
      for explaining the algorithms, directly from the CMS.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Expected outcomes: </b>
      <ul>
        <li>A CMS that will serve as a data source for the web app.</li>
        <li>Capability to add programming language implementation.</li>
        <li>Capability to add plain text translation.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      <b>Skills Required: </b> React, Python

    <h3>Project title: Algorithms Keeper</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Detailed Description: </b> Algorithms Keeper is an automated pull request reviewing bot. It 
      already automates initial review of Python pull requests; therefore, this project will extend that 
      tool to perform deeper analysis of proposed changes to code and documentation. The current tool 
      focuses only on Python submissions but TheAlgorithms currently has repositories for 25 programming 
      languages. Work should be done to make useful initial code reviews across multiple programming languages. 
      Automated reviews should be intuitive and self-documenting and should always encourage contributions.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Expected outcomes: </b>
      <ul>
        <li>Improve automated initial reviews of Python pull requests.</li>
        <li>Automate initial reviews for other languages.</li>
        <li>Study of which features (test coverage, self-documenting variable names, type hints, etc.) are most important for project maintainers.</li>
        <li>Improve sensitivity to the needs of submitters (esp. those learning the language and learning how to contribute to open source).</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Project title: Merlin Extension</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Detailed Description: </b> Currently, if you want to apply to some job, you visit the career page of the 
      job. Then, you fill the form with the same details you have filled for other jobs that you have applied for. 
      Sometimes, Google Chrome helps fill the form by autofill data, but this is not always possible. The forms may 
      ask your Twitter/LinkedIn profile URL and Google Chrome doesn’t save this. In this situation, you visit the 
      desired social page, copy the URL and then paste it on the form. Same happens when for skills and experience 
      filed in the application. In this project, we are trying to make a browser extension that is capable of saving 
      literally everything and autofills the job form or any type of form effectively. </p>
    <p>
      <b>Expected outcomes: </b>
      <ul>
        <li>A browser extension that stores personal and professional information.</li>
        <li>Save time for filling out forms by auto filling almost all the fields.</li>
        <li>Improve accuracy of the data you filled.</li>
      </ul>
